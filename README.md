This is a two player dice game built using JavaScript. 

To play, open new terminal and run ~$ open index.html 

Rules: 
Use the roll feature to roll the dice and score points, however beware of rolling a 1, which will negate all 
points held and give the other player a turn. Chose 'hold' to hold the point score held, and not risk rolling a 1. First player to 100 wins! 

Motivation 
Motivation to create this was to create a fairly simple game that two people could play.
Using CSS selectors, DOM manipulation, and organizing the cycle and flow of the game were also important motivating factors. 


Credits
This project was created based off the instruction and teaching of the udemy JS masterclass led by Jonas
Schmedtmann.
